# arduino-rgb-led-strip-controller

An LED controller was designed to be able to choose beetween 8 different colors and a music mode
with an RF remote control. In music mode the LED strip is emmiting different colors which correspond
in different volume levels. If volume level is low, the LED strip has low brightness and darker colors.
As the volume goes up, the LED strip becomes brighter and the colors become lighter until it turns white.
The LED strip can be turned off with the remote control.

In readme-files folder there are the list of components, the schematics and the RF remote control layout.
